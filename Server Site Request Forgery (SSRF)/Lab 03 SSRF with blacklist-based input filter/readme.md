We need to find whether localhost / admin is blacklisted.

First we try giving localhost , our request is blocked.

If we try in place of localhost as 127.0.0.1 then also its present in blacklist

We can use several techniques like short ip - 127.1 or 127.0.1, Long ip - 127.000.000.1 or encode the IP in several forms.

Now we are knowing that `http://127.1/` worked but is we give `http://127.1/admin` then it blocks. So we have to find a way to manipulate `/admin`.

If we give as `http://127.1/aDmIn`, as a result we will get the result

We can delete the user easily with url manipulation

Thus, we solved the lab.
