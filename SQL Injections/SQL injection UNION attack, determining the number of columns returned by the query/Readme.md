Here the Query was made as "SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE category = 'Pets'" 

As per the requirement of Lab Task we have to add "UNION SELECT NULL --" as payload in query parameters
but we don't know the number or Columns

" SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL -- "
