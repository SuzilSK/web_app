 ## Solution:

### Finding Users Table 

The database in use here is Oracle, which holds the table information in the all_tables-table.
I am interested in table_name. So I injected the query as payload ` UNION SELECT table_name, null from all_tables-- `.

### Finding Column in User Table 

The all_tab_columns-table holds information about the columns of each table, specifically the column_name column in Oracle Database. 
The proper string to inject is ` UNION SELECT column_name, null from all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_RQGNUR'-- `

### Finding all Username and Password from that column

Now I have all details to obtain the required usernames and passwords. I inject  ` UNION SELECT USERNAME_DEDQSJ,PASSWORD_NXDWXA from USERS_RQGNUR-- ` to form this query:
