Solution:

First find the database which is used

I want to extract both usernames and passwords, while only having a single string column. For this, I can concatenate multiple values into single fields. The syntax depends on the database engine, so find out which database is used to drive the page. 

` +Union+select+null,version()+from+users+-- `

### Extracting Username and Password
I know that users contain username and password.As I have just a single string column, I can either issue two queries and manually combine the data or concatenate these values into a single string to be able to extract them in one go.

` +union+select+null,username+||+'~~'+||password+from+users+-- `
