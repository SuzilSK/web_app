### Solution: 

Query made -

` SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' `

By Determining which particular column have the same data type as per previous Lab Task with injecting Null Payloads and string data

` SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT '3eWHU',NULL,NULL -- `

We need to use the UNION SELECT payload using 3 NULL values. Try adding value 33eWHU in one NULL value to see if it returns that string. If it does , then it means the column contains string data else it is not containing string data.
