## Solution: 
The lab application is a blog website with search functionality.

First try entering the following simple XSS payload to trigger an alert!

`"><script>alert(1)</script>`

But no popup came.

The innerHTML sink doesn't accept script elements on any modern browser.
if the search argument is provided, the innerHTML of a span-element is changed dynamically. Inserting JavaScript by using `<img src="hello" onerror=alert(1)>` as search parameter results in this HTML:

The resulting HTML looks like this-

The value of the src = 1 attribute is invalid and throws an error. This triggers the onerror event handler, which then calls the alert() function. As a result, the payload is executed whenever the user's browser attempts to load the page containing your malicious post.

This raises the alert box.
