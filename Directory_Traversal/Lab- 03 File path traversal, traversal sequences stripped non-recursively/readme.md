When we give ../etc/passwd , the web application strips the ../ so the user input is interpreted as etc/passwd.

To bypass this we need to give nested traversal sequences like ....//etc/passwd so that even if the server strips ../ so the resulting query which will be processed by the server will be ../etc/passwd.

First we give this i/p - ....//....//etc/passwd

We get this response containing 400 Bad Request.

Now when we try `....//....//....//etc/passwd` the it gives 200 OK message.
