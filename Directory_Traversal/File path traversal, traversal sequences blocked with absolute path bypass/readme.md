In this lab, the application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory, so we 'll use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as filename=/etc/passwd, to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.

We get the /etc/passwd file from the response.
