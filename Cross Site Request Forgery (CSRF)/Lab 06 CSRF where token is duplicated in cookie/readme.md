Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that the value of the csrf body parameter is simply being validated by comparing it with the csrf cookie.

As soon as an adversary is able to set cookie values, the CSRF-protection can be circumvented entirely.The token may or may not require the proper format, so I just try it out with an arbitrary short value:

Sure enough, the request goes through and the email is updated.

Perform a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater, and observe that the search term gets reflected in the Set-Cookie header. Since the search function has no CSRF protection, you can use this to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.

Create a URL that uses this vulnerability to inject a fake csrf cookie into the victim's browser:
```
/?search=hii%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=test
```

To create the exploit, I use the CSRF PoC generator of Burp Suite.And remove the auto-submit <script> block and instead add the following code to inject the cookie and submit the form:
